1.
One thing to be noted here is we alsways send oayload data during rendering..ant it is working 
at home.ejs,login.ejs ,registeer.ejs but not working in mixin/replyMdal (if only we include it
in postPage.ejs ) but work perfectly in (home.ejs)
2. So I changed <%=payload.userLoggedIn%> to userLoggedIn
 have converted userLogged In valriable in to client side variable--so that may be the reason
 ;;

 ***Sory for Misleeading** reasor for that when we refresh er were log ou an not
  using requiredLogin middleware to  checj that user is loggged in or not..
  so whenever we try to acces t hat page it shows that profile pic s not defined bcoz
  //we were logged out and we didn't have access of tha

3.** In ejs script [<%.......%>] to access the object like payload no need to use HTML escape
tage (X <%-,X<%=) ..just directly use payload.profileUser..this rule apply for every script tag
4. If we have to add class (int string format having spaece b/w them ) the to add it to 
ejs element use single Quote;
see ref..(a). mixin/createTab.ejs (b). mixin/createFollowButton.ejs;

4.**Get Vs Post***
(a). if we send data during get request that we have to access it (on - server) from 
req.query and for POST ,we have to access it form (on - server) req.body;

.If we are using Server side Variables which are sent during render we should usie the using 
payload  ..But if we want to send them to client side the we have to sedn using them 
into new script file and will have to make them available to client side

5.****Issues:: In comparison for CreateFollowButton.ejs in profilePage.ejs
we must have to use _id.toString() to use includes in ejs template ****
