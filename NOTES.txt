1.
One thing to be noted here is we alsways send oayload data during rendering..ant it is working 
at home.ejs,login.ejs ,registeer.ejs but not working in mixin/replyMdal (if only we include it
in postPage.ejs ) but work perfectly in (home.ejs)
2. So I changed <%=payload.userLoggedIn%> to userLoggedIn
 have converted userLogged In valriable in to client side variable--so that may be the reason
 ;;

 ***Sory for Misleeading** reasor for that when we refresh er were log ou an not
  using requiredLogin middleware to  checj that user is loggged in or not..
  so whenever we try to acces t hat page it shows that profile pic s not defined bcoz
  //we were logged out and we didn't have access of tha

3.** In ejs script [<%.......%>] to access the object like payload no need to use HTML escape
tage (X <%-,X<%=) ..just directly use payload.profileUser..this rule apply for every script tag
